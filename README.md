# ban-notifier
A simple bot for bans and mutes


# Setup

Setting up the bot is quite simple, just fill in all the blanks that say [INSERT] in the code and create a second discord server and get all of the members in your main discord to join. Make sure you also have the bot in the secondary server as well. That's it. 


# Usage

You can see some commands using .help but here's a list of all.

- .help - shows some commands
- .ban {user} {reason} bans a person
- .unban {user} unbans a person
- .mute {user} {reason} mutes a person
- .unmute {user} unmutes a person
- .clear {amount} deletes the last X messages
- .ping shows ping
- .dm {user} {message} dms user
- .status {user} shows status of user, ex. Banned: True
- .reject {user} rejects a ban appeal
- .fakeban {user} sends fake ban appeal message to user
- .fakeunban {user} sends fake unban message to user
- .getid {user} get discord id of user

That's all the commands.


# Q&A

# Q: Why do I need to create a secondary server?
A: It isn't neccesarry but it is if you want to let the person know that they are unbanned.

# Q: Help! The commands aren't working!
A: Make sure you use the @ of the user. If it doesnt show up its most likely because they are banned or left the server. If they were banned and you want to use a command on them go to log.txt and find the user id, it should look something like this: 
```
[15:32:46.703717] Banned abc123#0669 with user id of <@!733932411934736385> for reason: None
``` 
Now copy and paste the number in this format `<@!{number}>` then execute the command. Ex. `.status <@!733932411934736385>.`

# Q: The code shows the use of ban appeals but it doesnt have ban appeal command.
A: You're right the code does show the use of ban appeals! RezLawd made a great video on how to make a ban appeal bot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2415wZ2XaU. Follow the video, create a ban appeal channel and you're done!

# Q: How can I disable commands for people that aren't mod, admin, owner etc.?
A: Just add: 
```
@commands.has_permissions(manage_messages=True)
```
right after 
```
@client.commands()
```
and you should be good
